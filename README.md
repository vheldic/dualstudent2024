```

## Files & Usage
### backend/importCSVtoDatabase.py
When runing this Python program, the SQLite database named `database.db`, which is also located in the backend directory, will be populated with all elements of the `customers_sales_2021_2022.csv` file:
```
python importCSVtoDatabase.py
```

### app.py
This Python file uses Flask to work as an REST API between the frontend and backend of this project. Run the script to allow fetching from the frontend:
```
python app.py
```

### frontend/index.html
This HTML file uses a bootstrap link for easier css implementation and a vue cdn link for effective functionality. Opening the file, you will be able to search for items from the database. By clicking on the Search-Button, the data will be fetched using our API and presented as a table on the website. Sorting and filtering is possible too, by selecting a filter and the Sort-Button.

## Configuration
This project uses database.db in the database directory as default. By changing the name or path in `importCSVtoDatabase.py` and `app.py`, it is possible to target any other database.
